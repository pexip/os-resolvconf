resolvconf (1.46) unstable; urgency=low

  In the future the dhclient program will be shipped not in the
  dhcp3-client package but in the isc-dhcp-client package.  The
  latter version of dhclient will read its configuration from
  /etc/dhcp/ rather than from /etc/dhcp3/.  Consequently, in order
  to support the new version of dhclient, this resolvconf package
  includes hook script /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf
  which currently has the same contents as the old dhclient hook
  script /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf.  If you have
  made local changes to /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf
  and you plan to install the isc-dhcp-client package then you
  should consider making similar changes to
  /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf.
