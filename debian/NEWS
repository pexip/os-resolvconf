resolvconf (1.70) unstable; urgency=low

  The resolvconf update script for BIND 8 has been disabled.

  In Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) and earlier the resolvconf package included
  an update script /etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind which generated the
  file /var/run/bind/named.options from /etc/bind/named.conf.options
  such that name server addresses from resolvconf's database were
  written inside the forwarders{} option clause. If configured to read
  this dynamic named.options file, BIND 8's named would thus use name
  server addresses registered with resolvconf as forwarder addresses.
  The required manual configuration steps were described in
  resolvconf's README file.

  The script was written for BIND 8. BIND 8 was removed from Debian in
  Debian 5.0 (Lenny) and the script in question was dropped from the
  resolvconf package in Debian 7.0 (Wheezy), but was not deleted from
  the filesystem at that time unless the resolvconf package was purged.
  Hence, on machines on which earlier versions of resolvconf had been
  installed the script may still be present. In Debian 8.0 (Jessie) the
  script is renamed on upgrade to "bind.dpkg-old" and thus deactivated.
  See Debian bug report #687507 for more information.

  BIND 9 has replaced BIND 8 in Debian. It has been proposed that a new
  update script, /etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind9, be included in the
  bind9 package to enhance BIND 9 in the same way that the old script
  enhanced BIND 8. Anyone who would like this feature to be implemented
  is encouraged to add their voice either to Debian bug report #483098
  or to Ubuntu bug report #1091602.

  If you just want to re-enable the old script then please run the 
  following commands in a terminal.

      cd /etc/resolvconf/update.d
      sudo mv bind.dpkg-old mybind
