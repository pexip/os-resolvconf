                     MAINTAINER NOTES
                      for resolvconf

TODO
----
* Add a Systemd unit file obeying the dictates of policy ยง9.11.
  See #700846. 
  Instructions from https://wiki.debian.org/Systemd/Packaging:
  + Add Build-Depends on dh-systemd (>= 1.5)
  + Run dh_systemd_enable before dh_installinit
  + Run dh_systemd_start after dh_installinit

* File bug reports against all packages containing suppliers of nameserver
  information, asking each to add a resolvconf packaging-event hook script.
  Still to be submitted: dhcpcd5, pump, udhcpc, unbound

* In Jessie+1, drop the deletion of /etc/resolvconf/do-not-linkify-resolvconf.
* In Jessie+1, drop the use of /etc/resolvconf/run; use /run/resolvconf directly.

awk
---
We mustn't use awk in any runtime code but we may use it in the
maintainer scripts where convenient.

piuparts
--------
* Reports:

    ERROR: FAIL: After purging files have been modified:
      /etc/resolv.conf	 not owned

  but this is not a bug, since resolvconf can justifiably modify
  that file, which isn't an ordinary configuration file.


Things to remember
------------------
Remember to run debconf-updatepo after changing a template or po file.

When changing the interface-order file, remember also to change the
patterns in bin/list-records.

When changing the normalize_stdin function, remember also to update it
in debian/test-normalization.


Loop dangers
------------
Remember the interesting fact that postinst runs dpkg-event.d/foo
which probably runs /sbin/resolvconf which probably runs update.d/foo.
