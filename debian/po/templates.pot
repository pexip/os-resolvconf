"The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for dynamic "
"updating of the resolver configuration file. Part of the necessary "
"infrastructure is a symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to /run/resolvconf/"
"resolv.conf. If you choose this option then this link will be created; the "
"existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv."
"conf.d/original, and will be restored if this package is removed."

#. Type: boolean

"Declining this option will prevent future installations from recreating the "
"symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration file will not be "
"dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be activated following "
"instructions in the README file."

"Suppliers of name server information such as local caching name servers and "

"resolvconf program. However, although installation of the resolvconf package "
"triggers them to supply their information, some of them fail to do so."

"This bug would lead to loss of valid name server information on installation "
"of the resolvconf package if the following workaround were not adopted: "
"resolvconf includes the full contents of the pre-installation /etc/resolv."
"conf in its database until reboot. This has the drawback that name server "
"information is retained even if the associated interface is later "
"deconfigured. (This incorrect behavior is judged to be less harmful than the "
"alternative of losing valid information.)"

"Until the bug in question is fixed and the workaround removed, the only way "
