  * [ec06f8d] Change interface-order such that it more consistently

      "eth0.inet" had lower priority than "eth0.dhclient" had, and now
      has higher priority. So now a dns-nameservers option in an

      http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/01/msg00159.html
  * [eef5e1c] update.d/libc: Don't restart nscd any more. Nscd's hosts
      cache was disabled by default in 2007 so this was, by default,
      an unused feature. Nscd now spontaneously re-reads resolv.conf
      when it changes, so restarting nscd is no longer necessary.
      Ref: http://www.eglibc.org/archives/patches/msg00977.html
      Fixes LP#1110331.  Unfortunately, this change exposes a bug in
      nscd (http://bugs.debian.org/700385): nscd does not clear its
      hosts cache when it re-reads resolv.conf.

  * Standardly keep run-time data in /run instead of /lib/init/rw;

    Thanks to Roger Leigh for his help.
  * Create run-time data directories in the preinst instead of in the

    resolvconf's postinst runs, the data are not lost and no error 
    message is printed.
  * If someone has run resolvconf while updates were disabled, update
    when updates are enabled.
  * Include the contents of the original resolv.conf file in the
    database until the first reboot after installation.  The old behavior
    was to omit these contents unless link-tail-to-original was
    selected with the result that information was missing from
    resolv.conf until ifdown-ifup cycles.  The new behavior is not 
    correct either, since nameserver addresses are not removed when
    corresponding interfaces are deconfigured, but should have less
    unpleasant consequences than the old behavior.
  * Update the debconf template that discusses the problem just described.

    reboot the system.
  * Add da.po. (Closes: #623079)  Thanks to Joe Dalton.

    before ifupdown can be used and thus before ifupdown can call
    resolvconf).  [See entry for release 1.41]

  * fr.po update  (Closes: #244075)
  * Update pppconfig dependencies

resolvconf (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminate update-resolv and its man page since pppconfig will
    detect /sbin/resolvconf in the future
  * README
    + Update information about pppconfig
  * /etc/network/if-down.d/resolvconf:
    + No longer delete static|manual records with old-style names
  * /etc/init.d/resolvconf:
    + Clean up
    + Improve start method's creation of the run dir.
      This requires use of the /lib/init/readlink program that ships
      in initscripts 2.85-15.
  * debian/postinst:
    + Simplify hook script disabling code.
      This eliminates the lintian warning about using debconf in postinst
    + Remove old code that moved run directory out of /var/run, which
      is what experimental versions of this package used for a while
    + Replace this with new code that makes resolvconf use /dev/shm
      if possible and /etc/resolvconf/run/ otherwise.  (Closes: #213594)
  * debian/config:
    + Simplify hook script disabling code
  * debian/control:
    + Depend on initscripts >= 2.85-15
    + Suggest pppconfig >> 2.3
    + Conflict with pppconfig <= 2.3 since version 2.3 hook scripts futz
      with /etc/resolv.conf again
  * templates and their translations
    + Update to reflect the fact that not only versions prior to 2.2.0
      but also version 2.3 of pppconfig contains a rogue ppp hook script.
      While making changes to the French and Dutch translations I fixed
      several errors.
      I don't speak Portuguese so that translation now contains fuzzies.

resolvconf (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove characters from changelog of which lintian disapproves
  * Conflict with ifupdown << 0.6.4-4.1 because earlier versions
    didn't pass environment variables to "up" and "down" scripts.
    (Closes: #236999)  Thanks to Marius Gedminas for finding the bug.
  * Minor changes to initscript, /sbin/resolvconf, resolv.conf.d/head
  * Update README
    + Mention that pppd's usepeerdns option should be used.
      Thanks to jgmbenoit@wanadoo.fr for the suggestion. (Closes: #237570)
  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc
    + Don't put an argumentless search option in /etc/resolv.conf .
      Thanks to Wouter van Heyst for the fix.

 -- Thomas Hood <jdthood@yahoo.co.uk>  Sun, 21 Mar 2004 11:41:16 +0100

resolvconf (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/init.d/resolvconf
    * The start method now creates /etc/resolvconf/run/ and
      /etc/resolvconf/run/interface/ if they do not exist.  It also works
      if /etc/resolvconf/run/ is a symlink.  These changes allow resolvconf
      to work properly if /etc/resolvconf/run is a symlink to
      /dev/shm/resolvconf/, for example.
  * debian/control:
    * Conflict with whereami << 0.3.3 since version 0.3.3 is less
      incompatible with resolvconf than earlier versions were
  * README
    * Update info about whereami

resolvconf (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc
    * Rewrite so that it eliminates all duplicate nameserver addresses
      and search domains.  (Closes: #215232)
      Thanks to Marcus C. Gottwald for his help.
  * /sbin/resolvconf
    * Eliminate comments from records before storing.  Safety measure.
  * /etc/network/if-*.d/*resolvconf
    * Allow dns-* options in all methods of inet and inet6 interfaces
  * README: Minor updates
  * resolvconf(8): Updates
  * pt_BR.po: Update thanks to Andre Luis Lopes
  * fr.po, nl.po: Minor wording fixes

 -- Thomas Hood <jdthood@yahoo.co.uk>  Sat, 14 Jan 2004 19:00:00 +0100

resolvconf (1.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * /etc/network/if-down.d/resolvconf:
    * Delete lo.inet record too  (Closes: #226687)
    * Delete $IFACE record for dhcp method too.
      This works around bug #196865.  (Closes: #226675)
  * debian/control:
    * Update Description
    * Update Recommended dnsmasq version

 -- Thomas Hood <jdthood@yahoo.co.uk>  Tue, 10 Jan 2004 13:00:00 +0100

resolvconf (1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * all shell scripts:
    * Add lots of double quotation marks around variables for
      consistency's sake.  No functional changes (I hope!)
  * debian/control:
    * Adjust package relationship versions: Recommend or Suggest those
      versions of packages that have the best resolvconf support;
      Conflict with those versions of packages that don't work cleanly
      with resolvconf.  Note that bind9 is now to be preferred over bind
      because resolvconf support has been added to bind9's initscript.
      Thanks to LaMont Jones for fulfilling this wish (#199255)!
    * Update Description and remove double spaces
  * debian/postinst:
    * Remove downup code (Closes: #221954, #220159)
  * debian/rules
    * ... and put it in /usr/share/doc/resolvconf/examples/downup.sh
  * debian/templates:
    * Change prompts (English, French) re: downupping interfaces
  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc
    * Add semicolon.  Thanks to Mike.  This should allow the script to
      work with the woody version of sed.  (Closes other part of #221954)
    * Redirect stderr of sed pipe to /dev/null  (Closes: #222727)
      Otherwise the script fails when run by pump
    * Some minor bugfixes thanks to Marcus C. Gottwald
  * /etc/network/if-up.d/000resolvconf, /etc/network/if-down.d/resolvconf
    * Include address family name in the nameserver data set identifier
      (Closes: #223745)
  * README
    * Update info, especially re: bind9
  * debian/po/nl.po
    * Added, thanks to Tim Dijkstra  (Closes: #224041)
    * I tweaked it to bring it up to date
  * /etc/network/if-up.d/000resolvconf
    * Clean up
    * Allow dns-* options in loopback lifaces too

resolvconf (1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/po/fr.po
    * Added, thanks to Frederic ZULIAN  (Closes: #219403, #217680)
  * debian/preinst
    * Create /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d if necessary before
      moving resolv.conf backup file

 -- Thomas Hood <jdthood@yahoo.co.uk>  Thu,  9 Nov 2003 10:00:00 +0100

resolvconf (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    * Build-Depends on debhelper instead of Build-Depends-Indep.
      This is necessary because the clean rule uses debhelper commands.
      See policy 7.6 and #178809 and #191411.
      Ignore the lintian warning -- it is erroneous.
    * Suggest pcmcia-cs >= 3.2.5-1
    * Conflict with pcmcia-cs << 3.2.5-1
  * debian/rules
    * Install ifup hook script as "000resolvconf"  (Closes: #217389)
  * debian/config
    * Re-ask questions on reconfigure
  * debian/templates:
    * Corrections and clarifications.  My since apologies to translators
      for once again moving the target.
  * debian/po/pt_BR.po
    * Added, thanks to Andre Luis Lopes  (Closes: #216601)
  * debian/preinst
    * Rename already installed ifup hook script to "000resolvconf"
    * Delete /var/lib/resolvconf more carefully
  * debian/postinst
    * Generate up and down scripts with a sed script from Michael Weber.
      One advantage is that the interfaces are downed in the order that
      is the reverse of the order in which they were upped.
    * Delete /etc/resolvconf/run more carefully
    * Re-do configuration on every configure or reconfigure
    * Do debconf notification at high priority
  * /etc/network/if-up.d/000resolvconf
    * Work also with inet6 and manual ifaces
  * README
    * Update info re: pcmcia-cs
    * Fix some typos
  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc
    * Sort and uniq lines in the resolver configuration file
      (Partially addresses #215232)
    * Merge search lines  (Closes: #212670)
    The comment header of the dynamically generated resolv.conf file is
    now located in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head.
    /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base is to be used for base (static)
    entries that may be sorted and merged with other entries.
    /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail may be a symlink to ./original
    on initial installation but the admin can point this somewhere 
    else or replace it with a real file as he or she wishes.
    To "disable" it, point it at /dev/null.

  Many improvements in this release arose from comments by Michael Weber.

resolvconf (0.46) unstable; urgency=medium

  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind:
    * Remove semicolon from end of existing forwarders statement in
      named.conf.options  (Closes: #213698)
      Thanks to Manoj Srivastava for reporting this.
    * Use temporary file name with $$ and clean up on signal to exit
  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc:
    * Print message on stderr if /etc/resolv.conf is not a symbolic
      link to /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf .  This can be shut
      off by changing the value of an environment variable.
  * debian/control:
    * Conflict with xisp which also futzes with /etc/resolv.conf
    * Conflict with totd which does unpleasant things to /etc/resolv.conf
      and dhclient-enter-hooks
    * Add warning to the Description that the admin may have to
      do some manual configuration
  * debian/rules:
    * initscript stop at K89 -- this may fix #212780
    * remove binary-arch rule
  * debian/init:

  * README:
    * Add very short "Usage" section
    * Explain how to make pcmcia-cs use resolvconf instead of altering
      /etc/resolv.conf directly.  Thanks to Manoj Srivastava for this.
    * Re-order instructions.  Thanks to Osamu Aoki for good suggestions.
    * Miscellaneous minor updates
  * debian/config, debian/templates:
    * Post a debconf note if any of the following rogue hook scripts is
      still present, nonempty and executable:
        /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/000usepeerdns
        /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/0xisp-dns
        /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/0xisp-dns
      Ask for permission to disable scripts like these
    * Rewrite templates to increase clarity
  * debian/postinst:
    * Downup interfaces and restart DNS caches on reconfigure too
    * Disable (or remind the user to disable) rogue hook scripts
    * Copy original /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf
      so that there is some resolv.conf file at the target of the link
      if there is some failure in the postinst  (Closes: #212668)
  * debian/changelog:
    * Truncate -- include only the entries for non-experimental releases

  * debian/templates:
    * Tweak
  * debian/control:
    * Change ppp recommendation to >= 2.4.1.uus2-4
    * Conflict with pppoeconf << 1.0 since earlier versions still
      contain a /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/000usepeerdns script that overwrites
      /etc/resolv.conf unless the pppconfig package also happens to be
      installed.
  * debian/config, debian/templates
    * Post a debconf note if /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/000usepeerdns is still
      present, nonempty and executable
  * debian/postinst

        /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/000resolvconf
      (Closes: #212548)

    * On upgrade rename 
        /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/resolvconf
        /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/resolvconf
      to
        /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/000resolvconf

resolvconf (0.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * initscript:
    * Rework so that it calls update functions on start with "-i" option
  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc:
    * Prepend /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head and append
      /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail if they are present.
      This makes it easy for the user to prepend or append, respectively,
      an arbitrary file to the dynamically generated resolv.conf file.
      The immediate use for this feature is to allow the user to symlink
      /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to ./original.
    * Don't reload things if given the "-i" option
  * /etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind:
    * Don't reload things if given the "-i" option
  * resolv.conf backup file:
    * It is now stored at /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original .
      This makes possible "ln -s original /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail"
      as discussed above.
  * debian/preinst
    * Move the old backup file to the new location
    * Delete /var/lib/resolvconf which is no longer used
  * debian/config, debian/templates, debian/postinst:
    * Add installation option to symlink /e/r/r/tail to /e/r/r/original
  * debian/postrm
    * Remove /etc/resolvconf/run symlink or directory on purge
  * man/resolvconf.8

resolvconf (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminate /var/run/resolvconf
  * debian/config, debian/templates:
    * Change configuration process so that there is only one question.
      The question asks whether the package should linkify /etc/resolv.conf
      _and_ downup all interfaces _and_ restart all DNS caches.  The
      alternative is to do none of these things.  The debconf description
      now provides a lot more information about the alternatives.  The
      priority of the question is now high.  (Closes: #210283)
  * etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc:
    * Use temporary file name with $$ and clean up on signal to exit

  * /etc/resolv.conf/update.d/bind
    * Ignore chown errors because bind (version 8) does not create a
      "bind" group  (Closes: #209284).  Thanks to Dylan Thurston for

      to /var/run/resolvconf/ .  If /etc/resolvconf/run is a symlink to
      the latter directory then convert it into a directory.
    * Move confmodule to beginning of file because it reruns the script
    * Don't downup lo
    * Give dh_installinit the "--no-start" option since the meaning of
      the initscript "start" method has changed.
  * /etc/init.d/resolvconf
    * Start method now cleans /etc/resolvconf/run/ since it isn't in
      /var/run/ by any more.  This means that the start method should
      never be called when resolvconf is in use.  Use it only on boot.
  * README
    * Tweak
